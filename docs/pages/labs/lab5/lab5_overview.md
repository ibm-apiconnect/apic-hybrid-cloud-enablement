## Objective

In the previous labs, you have been working with an API that acts as a pass-through to a microservice application.

In this lab, you will expand the product offerings for **ThinkIBM**. In addition to the Inventory API, **ThinkIBM** wishes to provide API's that offer financing and shipping logistics to consumer applications. Your goal is to utilize existing enterprise and public assets to create these API offerings.

You will learn:

+ How to create a new API, including object definitions and paths
+ How to configure an API to access an existing SOAP service
+ How to import an existing API from an OpenAPI definition document (a.k.a Swagger)
+ How to map data retrieved from multiple API calls into an aggregate response
+ How to use GatewayScript directly within an API assembly

## Continue

Proceed to [Create a New API Project](lab5_create_new_project.html).
