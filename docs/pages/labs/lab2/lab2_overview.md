## Objective

At this point, we are familiar with creating working inside the API Designer.  Now we will create two REST APIs using instructions from the API Connect Knowledge Center Tutorials.  

In this lab, you will start with a new empty folder on your filesystem.  Please complete the following tutorials below.  You just need to get to the point of creating the API andnot publishing it.  We will get to that process soon enough.
