## Objective

At this point, you have created a Node.js microservice application called **inventory** that is configured with an `item` data model backed by a MySQL data source.

In this lab you will publish your **inventory** application source code to Bluemix where it will run in the cloud, managed and protected by your API Connect instance.

You will learn:

+ How to publish a Node.js microservice application to Bluemix using the API Connect Toolkit
+ How to access the Developer Portal to test your application's API
