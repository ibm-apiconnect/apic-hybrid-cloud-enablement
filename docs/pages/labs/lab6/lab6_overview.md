## Objective

Your work as an Application Developer and API Designer is now complete. It's time to switch roles and become an API Product Manager. The role of the API Product Manager is to take the developed assets and bundle them together using a go-to-market strategy.

In the case of **ThinkIBM**, you will publish the APIs from the `accessories` project together as a bundled product offering to API Consumers. Additionally, you will create two plans which have different levels of access to your APIs.

In the following lab, you will learn:

+ How to create a Product
+ How to attach APIs to a Product
+ How to create a Plan
+ How to publish a Product
