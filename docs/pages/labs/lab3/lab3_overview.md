## Objective

Great job working with the API Designer and REST APIs.  Now let's work with SOAP APIs.  Did you know though that you can mimic the same activities from the API Designer in the API Manager in Bluemix?  Well, we are about to find out as we create two SOAP APIs using the API Connect Knowledge Center Tutorials.  

## Assignment

First, let's log into Bluemix and access the API Manager from the listed services in your Dashboard. Navigate to the Drafts Menu from the Menu icon on the upper left of the screen. The interface should resemble the API Designer UI. 

Complete the following tutorials:

* [System API: Tutorial for creating a SOAP API](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSMNED_5.0.0/com.ibm.apic.apionprem.doc/tutorial_apionprem_creating_SOAP_API.html)

*  [Interaction API: Creating a REST API definition that invokes an existing SOAP service](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFS6T/com.ibm.apic.apionprem.doc/tutorial_apionprem_expose_SOAP.html
)

##Finished State

Upon completion, you should have two APIs completed in your Drafts folder on the Bluemix Cloud.  Let's leave them there for now.  We will come back to these at a later time.
