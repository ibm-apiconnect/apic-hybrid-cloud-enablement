## Objective

In this lab, you will gain a high level understanding of how analytics are used to visualize the information captured by the gateway node. You can filter, sort and aggregate your API event data; then present the results within correlated charts, tables and maps to help you manage service levels, set quotas, establish controls, set up security policies, manage communities and analyze trends. API Analytics is built on the Kibana V4.3 open source analytics and visualization platform, which is designed to work with the Elastic Search real-time distributed search and analytics engine.

You will learn:

+ How to view the analytics for a catalog inside of API Manager
+ How to create a custom dashboard
+ How to add visualizations to a dashboard 
+ How to customize and arrange visualizations in the dashboard
