## Objective

In this lab, you will get some experience working with IIB.  Although there are many different potential exciting integrations we can make with this software, we will be focusing on the use case to generate REST APIs that we will consume through API Connect. 

 

## Assignment

Please follow the two guides below to complete the lab.  The first will go over creating a sample IIB Flow and the second will walk through how to expose that through API Connect.
