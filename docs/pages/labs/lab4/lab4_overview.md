## Objective

In the previous lab, you created a new version of the **inventory** API which is secured with an OAuth 2.0 provider. At this stage, however, the changes are still in draft mode.

In order for the changes to take effect, you must publish the APIs to the developer portal. Recall though that the `inventory 1.0.0` version is already running and has active subscribers.

In this lab, you will explore the API Lifecycle controls offered by IBM API Connect and use them to replace the existing version of an API Product with a new version.

You will learn:

+ How to create a new API Product
+ How to use lifecycle controls to replace an existing version of an API Product
