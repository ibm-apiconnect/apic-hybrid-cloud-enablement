## Objective

In this lab, you will get some experience working with App Connect.  Although there are many different potential exciting integrations we can make with this software, we will be focusing on using the SalesForce Application Integration.  Enough talking, let's get to coding!!!  

## Pre-requisites

This lab will require you to have a Salesforce account.  If you do not have one, you can get a Developer Account at [https://developer.salesforce.com](https://developer.salesforce.com){:target="_blank"}.  If you connect to App Connect with a Trial account, the Salesforce events do not work. 


## Assignment

Please follow the two guides below to complete the lab.  The first will go over creating a flow in App Connect and the second will walk through how to expose that through API Connect.
