The environment that you will be working in today utilizes IBM's Bluemix Cloud to host your API Connect service, as well as back-end sample services and a microservice which you will create.

While the main components of the environment are cloud-based, the labs are designed to also make use of the API Connect Developer Toolkit - an application which runs locally on each developer's workstation that provides API design and deploy functionality. 

The prerequisite components have already been installed for you, so please proceed to the [Bluemix Account Setup](acct_setup_overview.html) section.

However, if you are exploring these labs on from your own workstation, you will need to install the Developer Toolkit and it's required components by following the [Environment Setup](env_setup_overview.html) instructions.
